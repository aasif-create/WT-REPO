<h1>The Sun</h1>

<p>Our Sun is a medium-sized star with a radius of about 435,000 miles (700,000 kilometers). Many stars are much larger â€“ but the Sun is far more massive than our home planet: it would take more than 330,000 Earths to match the mass of the Sun, and it would take 1.3 million Earths to fill the Sun's volume.</p>
